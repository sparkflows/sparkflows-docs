Windows Installation using Installer
====================================
You can download and use the installer to install or upgrade Fire Insights on your laptop or desktop.

It is not recommended to use this installer on servers, where you need better control over the installation process.



Step 1 : Verify Prerequisites
-----------------------------

#. **JDK 1.8:** Ensure you have Java 17 installed. You can download and install Java 8 from `here. <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html>`_
#. **Permissions:** 

   * Ensure you have sufficient permissions to download and install Sparkflows in the user directory.
   * You need write permission to download winutils.exe inside the Windows directory and set the environment path.
#. **Set JAVA_HOME:**

   * After installing Java, you may need to set JAVA_HOME.
   * If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your system, you can update the PATH using the steps outlined in either of the links below:

     * `Set JAVA_HOME on Windows 10 <https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10>`_
     * `Update PATH for Java <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml>`_

.. note::  On Windows, the PySpark engine will not get installed. Below are the functionalities that will not be available on bare metal windows install. We recommend either docker on windows to access all functionalities or install Sparkflows on Linux:

           * AutoML
           * Prophet
           * ARIMA
           * Scikit learn models
           * Keras/Tensorflow models
           * A few other python native packages

Step 4 : Post-Installation Configuration
----------------------------------------

#. After Sparkflows has started, navigate to the Installer Dashboard Menu. It will be updated with data such as the Sparkflows server URL, status of the Sparkflows server, Java version being used and its related information, winutils location, H2 database status, and its related information.
