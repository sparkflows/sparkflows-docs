Step 2 : Upload Data Files
===========================

The workflow needs data to work on. As the next step, you will upload a data file that you want to process in your workflow.

If your data is in a CSV file, click on 'Data Browsers' and select 'HDFS'. Your home directory will be displayed. Initially, it will be empty as you have not uploaded any file.

To use CSV files in the workflow, Fire Insights requires that you wrap them in datasets. In the next step, you will create datasets from the files you have just uploaded.
