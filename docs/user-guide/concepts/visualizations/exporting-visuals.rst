Exporting Visuals
=======================

Sparkflows enables you to export the output, dashboards, and visuals in various ways.

Exporting dashboard
-------------------

Since Sparkflows is browser-based, it makes easy to export the pages as PDF files.

- Go to the dashboard under your application where you have created a batch dashboard.
- Click on the ` `View` ` option to find the ` `Export` ` option.

Clicking on the ` `Export` ` option, ` ` Able to Visualize` ` option etc. will export the whole batch dashboard in PDF format on the local machine.

Exporting output
-----------------

Once the workflow is completed, the output result can be exported.

- Go to the application page where you created workflow & successfully executed it.

Clicking on the ``Executions`` tab will display the latest workflow execution on the list page.
