Version 3.3.7 - September, 2025
=====

New Features
----

Machine Learning
++++
  
* **Model Drift Tracking :** Added *ML Data Metrics* node to track and save model drift data. Drift is also displayed on the Models page in *graphical form* for better visualization. 
* **Enhanced Performance Monitoring :** Added graphical representations on the Models Page for the following:
  
  * Data Drift Over Time
  * Average Drift Over Time
  * Prediction Over Time
  * Metrics Over Time
* **Expanded Model Insights :** Added *Validation metrics* under Model Interpretation and *Test metrics* under Model Evaluation for H2O and SparkML models.
* **MLflow Integration :** When MLflow is enabled, models are automatically registered in MLflow for streamlined model management.
* **Automated Cleanup :** Added automation in *Model Scoring* to perform daily cleanup. Old scoring data older than the configured retention period (default: 30 days) will be deleted automatically, ensuring optimized storage. Cleanup is triggered only when more than 100 scoring records exist per model.

Dataset
++++
* **Oracle Dataset Support :** Added the ability to create datasets in Sparkflows using an Oracle connection and view its sample data.
* **Browse DB/Table Support :** Added the ability to browse databases and their tables during creation of dataset using connection.

Dashboard
++++
* **Oracle Dashboard Support :** Enabled creation of dashboards in Sparkflows using datasets created using Oracle Connection.

Platform Management
++++
* **Group-Level HDFS Browse Options :** Moved *HDFS Local Home Directory* to Groups Create/Edit pages, enabling support for multiple teams with tailored access.

Feature Engineering
++++
* **Group By Node :** Introduced the node that computes aggregated user-level features such as frequency, recency, average days between events, purchase sums, and customer age. It summarizes data per group (e.g., user ID) into compact feature sets.
* **Time Series Features Node :** Added the node that enriches each transaction with temporal features like days since last purchase, transaction hour, rolling counts, and seasonality indicators. Keeps the same row count while adding time-based behavioral insights.
* **Moving Average Features Node :** Introduced the node for calculating moving averages over defined time windows (e.g., 7 days). Supports rolling averages for amounts, sales, gaps, and unique users, helping uncover trends and seasonality.

Enhancements
----
Model Serving
++++

* **Performance Improvement using Process Pool :** Upgraded model serving implementation to support multiple requests simultaneously. A process pool has been implemented to allow multiple worker processes to handle requests in parallel, improving system throughput, reducing latency, and ensuring more stable performance under high load.

Documentation
----
* **ML Data Metrics :** Added documentation on *ML Data Metrics* node covering node configuration, workflow integration for training and prediction and the output generated. Refer here: :ref:`ML Data Metrics<ML Data Metrics>`
