    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/bike-rental-prediction`

    This workflow reads in a dataset and then it predicts the number of bikes to be rented in any given hour.

    ---  

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/farmers-market-prediction`

    Predict the number of farmer’s markets in a given zip code based on the income and taxes paid in a given area using the past data.

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/clustering-houses`

    Cluster the houses in the best possible way using K-Means algorithm availabe in Apache Spark ML.

    ---

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/tfidf`

    This workflow reads in a dataset. It then Tokenizes and performs TF-IDF on text content.

    ---

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/impute`

    This workflow imputes missing values.

    ---

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/feature-transformation`

    Feature transformation is simply a function that transforms features from one representation to another.

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/earthquake-prediction`

    Motivation behind earthquake prediction is to empower crisis measures to decrease demise and devastation, inability to give notice of a significant earthquake that happens, or possibly a satisfactory assessment of the hazard, can bring about legitimate risk, or even political cleansing.

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/multilayerPerceptronClassifier`

    Multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) is a classifier based on the feedforward artificial neural network. MLPC consists of multiple layers of nodes. Each layer is fully connected to the next layer in the network. Nodes in the input layer represent the input data.
