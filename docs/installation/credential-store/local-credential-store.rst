Local Credential Store
============================

Sparkflows enables you to create a Credential Store of type 'Local'. This Credential Store can be associated to multiple Application Credentials, which can then be used during the creation or updating of Application Connections. Credential Store-specific macros can also be applied to any field for added flexibility.

Follow the steps below for creating a Credential Store of type 'Local':

Step 1 : Navigate to the Credential Store
-------------

#. **Log in** to Fire Insights.
#. Go to the **Administration** page and click on the **Credential Store** card to access the Credential Store section.

#. Configure the Credential Store by filling the required details in the above fields as follows and click on **Save** button to create the Local Credential Store.
   
   * **STORE TYPE:** Select **Local** from the dropdown.
   * **STORE NAME:** Enter a unique name in this field. If the name is not unique, a validation error will appear below the text field.
   * **DESCRIPTION:** Optionally, add a relevant description if needed.

This Local Credential Store can now be associated to multiple Application Credentials and can be used within the Create/Edit process of Application Connection through Credential Store-specific macros.
