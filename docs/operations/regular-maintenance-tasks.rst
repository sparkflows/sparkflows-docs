Regular Maintenance Tasks
==============

It is important to do a few maintenance tasks regularly to have Fire Insights running smoothly over time.

Commands cheatsheet for H2DB is available at : https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/commands/h2-db.html


Backing up H2 Database
----------------

Fire Insights can be run with the embedded H2 database, or when an external database like MySQL, SQL server etc. It is important to back up the database regularly.

In order to backup the H2 database follow the steps below :

#. Stop Fire Insights.
#. Copy the H2 database files to another folder. This file is normally named "firedb.mv.db".
#. Start Fire Insights.


Cleaning H2 Database
--------------

Fire Insights by default uses the H2 embedded database. It is important to keep the size of the database in control. All the Fire Insights tables are relatively small except those which store the result of workflow execution.

Cleaning Old Workflow Executions
+++++++++++++++++

It is important to regularly delete the old workflow executions in order to keep the size of the H2 database in control.

#. Go to the ``Administration/Cleanup Data``.
#. On ``Clean Workflow Executions`` tab, click on ``Delete workflow executions`` drop down & delete workflow executions which are older than 30 days.

Compact H2 Database File
++++++++++++++++++

By default H2 database file is in the home folder of the user running Fire Insights. It is named as "firedb.mv.db".

If the H2 database file size grows too large (> 3GB), then follow the steps below for compacting it :

#. Make a copy of "firedb.mv.db" file to be safe.
#. Use the commands below for compacting it : ::

    java -cp ~/fire-x.y.z/db/h2/h2-1.4.199.jar  org.h2.tools.Shell
    URL: jdbc:h2:./firedb
    Driver : org.h2.Driver
    User : fire
    Password : fire

    SHUTDOWN COMPACT

    
Recreating the H2 Database to Further Reduce the Database Size
+++++++++++++

Recreating the H2 database, drastically reduces the size of the H2 database. Below are the steps for recreating it :

* Make a copy of "firedb.mv.db" file to be safe.
* Use the commands below for recreating it :

::

    java -cp ~/fire-x.y.z/db/h2/h2-1.4.199.jar  org.h2.tools.Shell
    URL: jdbc:h2:./firedb
    Driver : org.h2.Driver
    User : fire
    Password : fire
    
    SCRIPT TO 'mydb.sql'; 
    DROP ALL OBJECTS; 
    RUNSCRIPT FROM 'mydb.sql';

.. note::  Make sure to wait for 1 minute between "drop" and "runscript", the file size will be much smaller, as the database file will keep all old information for at least 45 seconds.

Deleting Old Files
----------------

Delete the following folders regularly :

* /tmp/fire/workflowlogs
* /tmp/fire/workflows

.. note::  The above folder is available inside Fire Insights home directory.
