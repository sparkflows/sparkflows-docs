Create Snowflake Connection
=============================

https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/user-guide/connection/storage-connection/snowflake/index.html

In order to read from or write to Snowflake, we need to first create a Snowflake Connection in Fire Insights.

To create a Snowflake connection using user credentials, you can follow the documentation here:  
https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/user-guide/connection/storage-connection/snowflake/snowflake.html

To create a Snowflake connection using OAuth, you can follow the documentation here:
https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/user-guide/connection/storage-connection/snowflake/snowflake-oauth.html

.. note::  Now, you can use above Snowflake connection in Read From SnowFlake, Write To SnowFlake & Execute Query In SnowFlake Processor in workflow editor.
