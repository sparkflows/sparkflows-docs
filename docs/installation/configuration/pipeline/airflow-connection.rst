Airflow Connection
--------------

Sparkflows enables you to create Airflow Connection and use it to submit Pipeline. Connections can be at various levels:

  * **Global**  : Everyone has access to these connections.
  * **Group**   : Users belonging to the group have access to these connections.
  * **Project** : The owner of the project and the groups with which the project has been shared with have access to the project level connections.

This page explains how to create an Airflow Connection in Fire Insights. Follow the steps below:

Step 1 : Enable Airflow in Sparkflows
======================================

* Login to **Fire Insights**.

* Navigate to  **Administration -> Configurations -> AIRFLOW** and enable Airflow by setting the value of below parameter to **true** and save the configuration.
