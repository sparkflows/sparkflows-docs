Introduction
======
This document provides an in-depth overview of MLOps practices, Sparkflows MLOps capabilities, and tools for model deployment, serving, monitoring, and governance.

Sparkflows MLOps platform supports scalable, governed, and automated machine learning operations across the full lifecycleâ€”from development to deployment, monitoring, and retraining. Its integrations with Spark, MLflow, Kubernetes, and CI/CD tools enable seamless adoption in modern enterprise environments.

Understanding MLOps and Its Purpose
------
**Definition**

MLOps is a set of practices and tools that automate and streamline the machine learning lifecycle, bridging data science and IT operations. Its key goals are efficient model deployment, continuous monitoring and maintenance, scalable, automated retraining and compliance, governance, and observability.

**Key Components**

* **Version Control :** Manages versioning for both models and data to ensure traceability.
* **CI/CD Pipelines :** Facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery for rapid iteration and deployment.
* **Automated Testing :** Verifies the performance and functionality of models before deployment.
* **Performance & Drift Monitoring :** Tracks model performance and detects drift to ensure reliability over time.
* **Governance & Security :** Enforces compliance, audit trails, and controlled access.

**Benefits**

By implementing MLOps, organisations can get following benefits:

* **Development Acceleration :** Reduces time spent on manual processes.
* **Error Minimization :** Identifies and resolves issues proactively.
* **Model Reliability Assurance :** Keeps models effective and up-to-date with changing data trends.

Sparkflows and MLOps Integration
------
**Model Deployment Using Sparkflows MLOps**

Enables deployment of various machine learning models built within Sparkflows or externally. Sparkflows supports both offline and online model serving, and deployment can be managed via a centralized UI or APIs.

**Summary of Sparkflows MLOps Capabilities**

The following table provides a consolidated overview of the key capabilities provided by Sparkflows in the MLOps lifecycle:

   * - Capability
     - Description
   * - Model Inference in ETL Pipelines
     - Inference embedded in Spark-based ETL pipelines using 450+ processors; supports data prep, transformation, and real-time scoring
   * - GCP Kubernetes Execution
     - Supports model execution on GCP Kubernetes clusters using container orchestration and Kubeflow integration. Models can be pushed to Compute Engine and exposed via API endpoints.
   * - Centralized Model Registry
     - Full versioning, metadata tracking, and model governance; integrated with MLflow for experiment and metric logging.
   * - Retraining & Recalibration
     - Automated retraining workflows triggered by alerts like drift detection (e.g., PSI > 0.3), using a champion-challenger approach.
   * - A/B Testing
     - Parallel deployment of models with output comparison, statistical analysis, and collaborative promotion workflows.
   * - Model Monitoring
     - Real-time dashboards for latency, accuracy, anomaly detection, drift alerts; inference results stored in a time-series database. 
   * - CI/CD with SonarQube
     - Supports customizable CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and SonarQube integration for code quality..
   * - Offline & Online Model Serving
     - Batch and real-time serving supported for scalable, high-throughput predictions or low-latency real-time inference.
   * - Model Governance & Security
     - Enterprise-grade security including SSO, RBAC, audit trails, explainability, and secure sharing.
