For Unstructured Data
***************************
Unstructured data includes content that lacks a predefined format, such as text files, PDFs, or images. If you want the chatbot to process documents, analyze text-based data, or provide insights from unorganized content, this is the ideal configuration.

 **Chatbot Basic**

 * **NAME:** Enter the name of the chatbot.
 * **DESCRIPTION:** Provide a description of the chatbot.
 * **GEN AI CONNECTION:** Select the required connection from the list, which includes Open AI, Gemini, Bedrock, etc.

 **Data Source Configuration**

 * **VECTOR DB:** Select the VectorDB connection from the list like pinecone, milvus etc.
 * **VECTOR DB INDEX:** Enter the VectorDB index name where the embedding should be done.
 * **VECTOR DB INDEX NAMESPACE:** Enter the VectorDB index namespace where the embedding should be done.

 
 **Privileges**

 * **SAVE TO DATABASE:** Enabling this option will allow the chatbot to upload files to the VectorDB in the selected chatbot topic.
 * **START CHAT WITH FILE:** Enabling this option will allow the chatbot to chat with selected files in the chatbot thread.
 
 .. note:: Here **selected file** refers to a file that you choose to upload or attach in the chat. For example, if you upload a PDF, spreadsheet, or text file, that becomes the "selected file". Enabling the "START CHAT WITH FILE" option allows the chatbot to read, analyze, and respond based on the contents of the selected file. A **thread** is a conversation session within the chat. So, if you start a new chat, it creates a new thread and if you continue chatting without starting fresh, youâ€™re staying in the same thread.


  


  
  
 


**For Structured Data**

Structured data is organized and stored in relational databases, making it ideal for querying specific records, performing analytics, or extracting information from well-defined tables. If you want the chatbot to interact with data stored in structured formats like SQL databases, choose this option.

 * **DESCRIPTION:** Provide a description of the chatbot.
 * **GEN AI CONNECTION:** Select the required connection from the list, which includes Open AI, Gemini, Bedrock, etc.
 * **DATABASE CONNECTION:** Select the required connection from the dropdown list.




* Once chatbots (chat assistants) are created, they will be **visible inside each project within the chat tab** in the format shown below:

* Once the chatbot is created, click on **Edit Chat** icon from the chatbot list page, as shown below. You will get an **option to add files and their embeddings** to the VectorDB. These embeddings will be used to retrieve query responses from the VectorDB.
