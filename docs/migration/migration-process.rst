Workflow Migration Process
====
This guide outlines the step-by-step process for migrating an existing Alteryx Designer workflow into Sparkflows, from importing and configuring the workflow to validating results after execution.

Follow the steps below:

Step 1 : Import the YXMD File
----

- Upload your existing Alteryx Designer workflow **(.yxmd)** into Sparkflows.

- The system parses the file, interprets the configuration, and generates a corresponding Sparkflows workflow.

- Connections, transformations, and dependencies are automatically mapped to equivalent processors in Sparkflows.

- Any unsupported elements are highlighted for easy review and adjustment.

Step 2 : Upload Required Dataset(s)
----

- After the workflow conversion completes, upload all datasets referenced in the workflow.

- Sparkflows supports multiple formats such as **CSV**, **Parquet**, **JSON**, and external data connections.

- Ensure that the dataset schema and field names match those expected by the original workflow to maintain consistent results.

- Datasets can be uploaded directly through the Sparkflows interface or linked from existing storage locations.

Step 3 : Run the Workflow
----

- Execute the converted workflow using Sparkflows workflow execution engine.

- This can be performed entirely on your **local laptop or desktop**, making it easy to test without depending on an external environment.

- During execution, Sparkflows manages each processorâ€™s configuration and data flow as defined in the converted workflow.

- Execution status, logs, and performance details can be viewed directly in the Sparkflows interface for full transparency.

Step 4 : Validate Results
----

- Use Sparkflows **data validation and comparison capabilities** to verify that the workflow output matches the original Alteryx results.

- You can compare data outputs, inspect intermediate node results, and confirm transformations across steps.

- Adjust node parameters or dataset paths if differences appear.

- Validation can be repeated until full alignment is achieved, ensuring confidence before scaling to production.
