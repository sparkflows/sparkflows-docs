Architecture & Deployment
=========================

Sparkflows can be installed in one of two ways:

* On a standalone machine. In this case all the processing would happen within the single process.

  * This can be used to run Sparkflows on your laptop/desktop.
  
* On the Edge node of a Hadoop/Spark Cluster.

  * In this case, the jobs for processing would be submitted to the Hadoop/Spark Cluster.
