       arn:aws:iam::<account-1-id>:role/assume-role-bucket1

      :width: 60%

#. Once the Group is attached to any User in Fire Insights application, **save** the Configurations.

Step 5 : Access S3 Bucket
--------------
#. Go to **DATA > AWS S3**, you will see the S3 Bucket listed as below. Now, you can use it for creating workflow in the Node.

.. note:: Currently users can access the S3 resources by assumming the role. When user belongs to multiple user groups and each group is attached with different roles, then role from the first group will be assumed during the S3 access.
