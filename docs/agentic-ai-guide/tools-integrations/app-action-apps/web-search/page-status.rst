   Sends a HEAD request, following redirects, and returns the HTTP status and the final URL after them.

Before you start
----------------

* A Serper (searches only) connection. See :doc:`how to set one up </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/web-search>`.

Add this step
-------------

#. Drag **App Action** from **Commonly used** onto the canvas and connect it where the step belongs.
#. **App:** choose **Web Search**.
#. **Action:** under **Page**, choose **Check a URL**.
#. **Details:** choose your Serper (searches only) connection, click **Test**, then fill in the boxes below.
#. Click **Load the fields from Web Search** so later steps can use the columns, then **Save action**.

Fill in the details
-------------------

Type a value, or click a field under **What arrives here** to put a value from an earlier step into the box.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **URL**
     - No
     - The address to request, with any query parameters in it; https:// is added when no scheme is given, and cloud metadata and link-local addresses such as 169.254.169.254 are refused. For example ``https://api.example.com/v1/orders?status=open``.

Under **Advanced settings**:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **Nested fields**
     - No
     - Some records keep a value inside another value, such as a priority inside an issue. This decides how those inner values become columns.

       * ``deep`` (default): Every inner value gets its own column, named with dots, such as ``fields.priority.name``.
       * ``oneLevel``: Only the first level is split. Anything deeper stays in one column as JSON text.
       * ``json``: Each inner value stays whole, in one column of JSON text.

       See the example below the table.

**Nested fields, by example.** Take a record ``{"id": 7, "fields": {"priority": {"name": "High"}}}``. Each choice gives you these columns:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
   :class: tool-table

   * - Choice
     - Columns you get
   * - ``deep``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority.name`` = ``High``
   * - ``oneLevel``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority`` = ``{"name": "High"}``
   * - ``json``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields`` = ``{"priority": {"name": "High"}}``

Keep ``deep`` unless a later step needs the whole inner value as JSON.

What it passes on
-----------------

The records come out as rows, one per record. Click **Load the fields from Web Search** to see the columns before you save.

Start a flow from it
--------------------

A :doc:`Trigger </agentic-ai-guide/triggers-automation/triggers>` can watch Web Search with this action and start the flow when something new turns up. Pick **Web Search** in the Trigger, then the event.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 32 68
   :class: tool-table

   * - Event
     - What it reports
   * - **Page status changed**
     - URL is the address to check with a HEAD request that follows redirects. The first check records the HTTP status; later checks report the address with its status and final URL whenever the status differs, for example 200 to 503. An address that cannot be reached at all fails the check.

Let an agent decide instead
---------------------------

To let an agent call **Check a URL** only when a request needs it, add the :doc:`Check a URL tool </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/web-search/page-status>` to an Agent Node.
