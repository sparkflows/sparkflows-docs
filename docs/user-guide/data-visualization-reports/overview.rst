Overview
======

Sparkflows allows users to create reports based on a variety of data. It enables users to create **comprehensive reports** by combining outputs from various processors into a **unified, interactive user interface**. These processors can generate outputs in different formats such as **tables, charts, maps, and simple strings**. Reports consolidate these diverse outputs to provide insightful visualizations and summaries in a **single view**.

For example, a report can display a combination of the below in one view:

* A chart showing the number of bike rentals per hour,


* Another chart summarizing rentals per day,


* A map indicating total rentals per city.


Thus, reports offer a powerful way to visualize and interpret data across multiple dimensions.
