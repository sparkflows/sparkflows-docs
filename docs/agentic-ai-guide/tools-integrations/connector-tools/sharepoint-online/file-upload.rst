   Uploads a file from the engine's disk into a folder of the site's default document library and returns the stored file; a file of the same name there is replaced. Files of up to 250 MB are supported.

Before you start
----------------

* A Microsoft Graph or SharePoint connection. See :doc:`how to set one up <../sharepoint-online>`.
* The account behind the connection must be allowed to change this data in SharePoint Online.

Add it to your agent
--------------------

#. In Agent Studio, open the **Tools** group and click **Add tools**, or click **+ Tool** on an Agent Node.
#. Choose **SharePoint Online** under **Connectors** and connect your Microsoft Graph or SharePoint connection.
#. Tick **upload** in the **File** row, then click **Add to agent**.

The agent now sees ``sharepoint_online_file_upload`` and calls it when a request needs it.

What the agent fills in
-----------------------

The agent fills these in from each request. To pin a value so the agent cannot change it, set it under **Fixed settings**.

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Required
     - What it means
   * - ``filePath``
     - text
     - Yes
     - The full path of the file on the engine's disk, such as the path column an attachment or download step returns. Example: C:/data/invoices/inv-4471.pdf.
   * - ``site``
     - text
     - No
     - The site as its URL, name or id; blank uses the site on the connection. Example: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Finance.
   * - ``folder``
     - text
     - No
     - The folder to put the file in, as a path such as TestData/Reports or an item id; blank is the top of the library.
   * - ``fileName``
     - text
     - No
     - The name to give the file in SharePoint; blank keeps the file's own name. Example: invoice-4471.pdf.

.. note::

   Each call waits for :doc:`your approval </agentic-ai-guide/safety-guardrails/human-in-the-loop>` before it changes anything in SharePoint Online.

Need it on every run?
---------------------

To run **Upload a file** every time a flow reaches it, without the agent deciding, use the :doc:`Upload a file App Action </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/app-action-apps/sharepoint-online/file-upload>`.
