   Saves the attachments of one or more emails into a folder on the engine's disk, without reading them, and returns one row per file: the email it came in, the file name, type and size, path (where the file was saved) and save\_status (saved, skipped when the file was already there, or not\_a\_file for an attached item or link).

Before you start
----------------

* A Microsoft Graph connection. See :doc:`how to set one up </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/outlook-mail>`.

Add this step
-------------

#. Drag **App Action** from **Commonly used** onto the canvas and connect it where the step belongs.
#. **App:** choose **Outlook Mail**.
#. **Action:** under **Attachment**, choose **Download email attachments**.
#. **Details:** choose your Microsoft Graph connection, click **Test**, then fill in the boxes below.
#. Click **Load the fields from Outlook Mail** so later steps can use the columns, then **Save action**.

Fill in the details
-------------------

Type a value, or click a field under **What arrives here** to put a value from an earlier step into the box.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **Mailbox**
     - No
     - The address of the mailbox, for example someone@company.com.
   * - **Message, folder or attachment id**
     - No
     - The message to act on (several comma-separated for attachments); for a list or search, the folder (inbox, sentitems, drafts, archive or a folder id); for one attachment messageId/attachmentId. For example ``inbox, or a message id from a list step``.
   * - **Search text**
     - No
     - Outlook's search: words, from:, subject:, hasattachments:yes. For example ``invoice from:billing@vendor.com``.
   * - **Fields to return**
     - No
     - Columns to keep: id, conversationId, from, to, cc, subject, receivedDateTime, sentDateTime, preview, body, isRead, importance, hasAttachments, categories, webLink. Blank keeps them all. For example ``from, subject, receivedDateTime, preview``.
   * - **Limit**
     - No
     - How many rows at most. A run from the canvas previews 20. Default: ``100``.
   * - **File types**
     - No
     - Only attachments with these extensions, comma-separated, for example pdf,docx. Blank takes every attachment.
   * - **Save into folder**
     - No
     - A folder on the machine the engine runs on, for example C:\\Data\\Invoices or /data/invoices. The full path of each saved file comes back in the path column. Blank uses ~/.fireagent/outlook\_attachments.
   * - **A folder per email**
     - No
     - Where the saved files go.

       * ``true`` (default): Each email's files go in their own sub-folder, named after the email.
       * ``false``: Every file goes straight into the folder.

       Two files with the same name are kept apart as ``name-2``.
   * - **If the file is already there**
     - No
     - What to do when the folder already holds a file with the same name.

       * ``overwrite`` (default): Replace the old file.
       * ``keep both``: Keep both. The new file gets the next free number.
       * ``skip``: Keep the old file and skip the new one.

       The ``save_status`` column says ``saved`` or ``skipped``.

Under **Advanced settings**:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **Extra query parameters (JSON)**
     - No
     - Sent to the API unchanged, for a filter this form has no field for. For example {"timeMin": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z"}.
   * - **Nested fields**
     - No
     - Some records keep a value inside another value, such as a priority inside an issue. This decides how those inner values become columns.

       * ``deep`` (default): Every inner value gets its own column, named with dots, such as ``fields.priority.name``.
       * ``oneLevel``: Only the first level is split. Anything deeper stays in one column as JSON text.
       * ``json``: Each inner value stays whole, in one column of JSON text.

       See the example below the table.

**Nested fields, by example.** Take a record ``{"id": 7, "fields": {"priority": {"name": "High"}}}``. Each choice gives you these columns:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
   :class: tool-table

   * - Choice
     - Columns you get
   * - ``deep``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority.name`` = ``High``
   * - ``oneLevel``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority`` = ``{"name": "High"}``
   * - ``json``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields`` = ``{"priority": {"name": "High"}}``

Keep ``deep`` unless a later step needs the whole inner value as JSON.

What it passes on
-----------------

The records come out as rows, one per record. Click **Load the fields from Outlook Mail** to see the columns before you save.

A run from the canvas previews 20 rows, whatever **Limit** says.
