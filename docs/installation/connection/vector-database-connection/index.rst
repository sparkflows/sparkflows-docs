Vector Database Connections
=================================
These connections provide integration of Sparkflows with a vector database, which is designed to store, index, and retrieve high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently. These databases are commonly used in AI, machine learning, and search applications where similarity search (e.g., finding similar images, texts, or recommendations) is essential.

**Vector DB Requirements**

The Vector DB should ideally support the following:

* High-dimensional vector storage: The ability to store and index high-dimensional vectors generated by the embedding model.
* Efficient similarity search: The capability to perform fast similarity searches (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors) on the stored vectors.
* Scalability and performance: The Vector DB should be able to handle a growing number of vectors and queries while maintaining fast response times.
* Integration with other services: The Vector DB should be able to integrate with the existing infrastructure, including Azure OpenAI and potentially other services.

Fire Insights integrates seamlessly with vector databases like Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate, and Milvus through their APIs and SDKs.
