Overview
========

A pipeline in Fire Insight defines a sequence of workflows. Processing steps pass through the sequence, typically in a linear manner, where each workflow performs a specific operation or transformation.

Fire Insights provides mechanism to to create, execute and schedule Pipelines. Thus helping in automating executions.

It enhances the implementation experience of Data Engineering, Data Science, CI/CD and various Machine Learning Use Cases.

Along with orchestration Pipeline also extend capability of defining parameters in a single window which can be used by the child workflows.

It also facilitate to add emails ids which can be notified on success or failure of Pipeline execution.

A Pipeline can be trigggered in below two ways:

* Manual Execution of a Pipeline
* Execution of Pipeline using a Schedule
