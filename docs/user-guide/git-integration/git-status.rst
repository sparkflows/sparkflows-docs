Sparkflows can show the changes related to Workflows, Analytical Apps and Pipelines yet to be pushed to Git via the ``Git Status`` Button. 

To access ``Git status``, open a project and select ``Workflows``. You would see a page similar to below.

If the workflow has not been pushed to Git before, a pop up would show up stating ``There is no previous version available to show the diff``.
