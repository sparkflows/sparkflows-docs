Snowflake
==========

Fire Insights has ReadSnowflake and WriteSnowflake processors for reading data from and writing data to Snowflake.

Creating Snowflake Connection
------------------

The first step is to create a connection to Snowflake, if you have not already created it. The below page has the details for creating Connection to Snowflake.

Reading from Snowflake Table
-------------------

The below workflow does the following:

* Reads Snowflake Table.
* Prints a few records of the DataFrame.

Processor Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It reads Table using Read From Snowflake processor.

* CONNECTION  : Connection created for Snowflake.
* SF DATABASE : Snowflake Database Name.
* SF SCHEMA : Snowflake Schema Name.
* SF WAREHOUSE : Snowflake Warehouse Name.
* SF TABLE : Snowflake Table Name.

Printing the Results
^^^^^^

It prints the first few records of the DataFrame.

Write to Snowflake
------------------

The below workflow does the following:

* Reads Housing Dataset.
* Write it to Snowflake Table.

Reading from CSV File
^^^^^^

It reads Housing data from a CSV File using Read CSV Processor.

Processor Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write results to Snowflake
^^^^^^

It saves CSV File in specified Snowflake Table.

* CONNECTION  : Connection created for Snowflake.
* SF DATABASE : Snowflake Database Name.
* SF SCHEMA : Snowflake Schema Name.
* SF WAREHOUSE : Snowflake Warehouse Name.
* SAVE MODE : Append, Overwrite, ErrorifExists & Ignore.
* SF TABLE : Snowflake Table Name.

Once the workflow is executed successfully, the CSV File will be written to Snowflake Table.
