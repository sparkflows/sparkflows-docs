The script below gets a group based on the id

For example if we want to get the information about group 1


* Group id :1::

    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/groups/1" -H "accept: */*" -b /tmp/cookies.txt
    
* Example response ::

      "name": "DEFAULT",
      "hdfsLocations": "",
      "groupProperties": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "key": "key",
          "value": "value"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "key": "key2",
          "value": "value2"
        }
      ]
    }

::
    
       curl -X DELETE "fire-url-host:8080/ap/v1/groups/$GROUPNUMBER" -H "accept: */*" -b /tmp/cookies.txt
