Rest API Client
====

Sparkflows provides a node to **execute REST services** such as **POST**, **GET**, and **PUT** requests. This node enables seamless integration with external systems or services by allowing API communication directly within a workflow.


The **Rest API Client** node supports the execution of REST APIs using standard HTTP methods: POST, GET and PUT

In the **InferSchema** tab, the node displays the schema of the response returned by the API, allowing downstream nodes to process the returned data accordingly.
