   * - Title
     - Description
   * - Data Cleansing
     - This node cleans incoming dataset by removing null rows, columns, by replacing missing values and by changing cases of the string data.
   * - Drop Null Rows For Selected Columns
     - This node deletes rows having null values in the selected columns.
   * - Drop Rows With Null
     - This node creates a new DataFrame by dropping rows that contain null values.
   * - Find And Replace Using Regex
     - This node finds and replaces text in a column containing a string.
   * - Find And Replace Using Regex Advanced
     - This node finds and replaces text in a column containing a string.
   * - Dedup
     - This node is used for problems like entity resolution or data matching. Entity resolution or data matching is the problem of finding and linking different mentions of the same entity in a single data source or across multiple data sources.
   * - Drop Duplicate Rows
     - Returns a new dataset that contains the unique rows from this Dataset. When user selects columns in the node, it returns a new Dataset after removing the duplicate rows, considering uniques in the subset of column selected by user
   * - Remove Duplicate Rows
     - This node takes an array of fields and compares rows in those fields. If they match fully, then it considers it a match. From the matches, it would randomly take one row and drop the rest.
   * - Remove Unwanted Characters
     - This node removes unwanted characters.
   * - Remove Unwanted Characters Advanced
     - This node removes unwanted characters from multiple columns.
 

Data Cleansing
