Salesforce Connection
==============

Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Data Cloud (formerly known as Salesforce Customer Data Platform (CDP)) are two distinct offerings from Salesforce designed to address different business needs, although both can complement each other in a Salesforce ecosystem.

Salesforce Sales Cloud
-------

Sales Cloud is primarily focused on customer relationship management (CRM), specifically for sales teams. It helps businesses automate, manage, and optimize the entire sales process, from lead generation to deal closure.

Salesforce Data Cloud
-------
Data Cloud (formerly Salesforce CDP) is aimed at enabling businesses to unify and analyze customer data from various sources. Itâ€™s primarily used to create a single customer view, enabling businesses to deliver more personalized experiences across marketing, sales, and service.


Sparkflows supports connecting to both offerings from Salesforce, Data Cloud as well as Sales Cloud.
