   Lists files and folders with their name, type, size, dates and web link.

Before you start
----------------

* A Google connection. See :doc:`how to set one up </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/google-drive>`.

Add this step
-------------

#. Drag **App Action** from **Commonly used** onto the canvas and connect it where the step belongs.
#. **App:** choose **Google Drive**.
#. **Action:** under **File**, choose **List files**.
#. **Details:** choose your Google connection, click **Test**, then fill in the boxes below.
#. Click **Load the fields from Google Drive** so later steps can use the columns, then **Save action**.

Fill in the details
-------------------

Type a value, or click a field under **What arrives here** to put a value from an earlier step into the box.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **File or folder id**
     - No
     - The id of the file; for getMany the folder to list, for upload the folder the files go into.
   * - **Fields to return**
     - No
     - Comma-separated field names. Blank returns the default set. For example ``id, name, webViewLink, modifiedTime``.
   * - **Limit**
     - No
     - How many rows at most. A run from the canvas previews 20. Default: ``100``.

Under **Advanced settings**:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **Extra query parameters (JSON)**
     - No
     - Sent to the API unchanged, for a filter this form has no field for. For example {"timeMin": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z"}. For example ``{"$top": "50"}``.
   * - **Nested fields**
     - No
     - deep spreads nested objects all the way into dotted columns, for example fields.priority.name. oneLevel stops after one level (fields.priority holds JSON). json keeps each object as one JSON text column. Choices: ``deep``, ``oneLevel``, ``json``. Default: ``deep``.

What it passes on
-----------------

The records come out as rows, one per record. Click **Load the fields from Google Drive** to see the columns before you save.

A run from the canvas previews 20 rows, whatever **Limit** says.

Start a flow from it
--------------------

A :doc:`Trigger </agentic-ai-guide/triggers-automation/triggers>` can watch Google Drive with this action and start the flow when something new turns up. Pick **Google Drive** in the Trigger, then the event.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 32 68
   :class: tool-table

   * - Event
     - What it reports
   * - **File created in a folder**
     - Folder id is the id of the folder to watch, the part of its address after /folders/. Reports each file uploaded, created or copied directly into it; files in its subfolders are not included.
   * - **File added or changed in a folder**
     - Folder id is the id of the folder to watch, the part of its address after /folders/. Reports each file directly inside it that is added or edited, with who changed it last in lastModifyingUser.
   * - **File added to a folder (moves included)**
     - Folder id is the id of the folder to watch, the part of its address after /folders/. The first check records what the folder holds; later checks report each file that appears in it, uploaded, copied or moved in.
   * - **Folder created in a folder**
     - Parent folder id is the id of the folder to watch, the part of its address after /folders/. Reports each folder created directly inside it.

Let an agent decide instead
---------------------------

To let an agent call **List files** only when a request needs it, add the :doc:`List files tool </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/google-drive/file-getmany>` to an Agent Node.
