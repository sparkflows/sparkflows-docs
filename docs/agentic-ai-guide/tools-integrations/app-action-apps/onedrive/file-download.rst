   Saves one file to the engine's disk and returns its details with the saved path and its text: the words of a PDF, Word, Excel, text or CSV file, with text\_status ok, password\_protected, no\_text (a scan) or unsupported.

Before you start
----------------

* A Microsoft Graph connection. See :doc:`how to set one up </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/onedrive>`.

Add this step
-------------

#. Drag **App Action** from **Commonly used** onto the canvas and connect it where the step belongs.
#. **App:** choose **OneDrive**.
#. **Action:** under **File**, choose **Download a file and read its text**.
#. **Details:** choose your Microsoft Graph connection, click **Test**, then fill in the boxes below.
#. Click **Load the fields from OneDrive** so later steps can use the columns, then **Save action**.

Fill in the details
-------------------

Type a value, or click a field under **What arrives here** to put a value from an earlier step into the box.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **User**
     - No
     - The address whose OneDrive this is, for example someone@company.com.
   * - **File or folder id**
     - No
     - The id of the file or folder to act on. For upload, the folder to put the files in: an id or a path such as Reports/2026; blank is the top.
   * - **Fields to return**
     - No
     - Comma-separated field names. Blank returns the default set. For example ``name, size, webUrl``.
   * - **Save into folder**
     - No
     - A folder on the engine's disk; the path of each saved file comes back in the path column. Blank uses a folder under ~/.fireagent.
   * - **PDF password (optional)**
     - No
     - For PDFs that arrive locked. Without it a locked PDF comes back with text\_status = password\_protected.
   * - **Text kept per file**
     - No
     - Characters of text kept per file; the rest is cut. Default: ``20000``.

Under **Advanced settings**:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **Nested fields**
     - No
     - Some records keep a value inside another value, such as a priority inside an issue. This decides how those inner values become columns.

       * ``deep`` (default): Every inner value gets its own column, named with dots, such as ``fields.priority.name``.
       * ``oneLevel``: Only the first level is split. Anything deeper stays in one column as JSON text.
       * ``json``: Each inner value stays whole, in one column of JSON text.

       See the example below the table.

**Nested fields, by example.** Take a record ``{"id": 7, "fields": {"priority": {"name": "High"}}}``. Each choice gives you these columns:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
   :class: tool-table

   * - Choice
     - Columns you get
   * - ``deep``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority.name`` = ``High``
   * - ``oneLevel``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority`` = ``{"name": "High"}``
   * - ``json``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields`` = ``{"priority": {"name": "High"}}``

Keep ``deep`` unless a later step needs the whole inner value as JSON.

What it passes on
-----------------

The records come out as rows, one per record. Click **Load the fields from OneDrive** to see the columns before you save.

Let an agent decide instead
---------------------------

To let an agent call **Download a file and read its text** only when a request needs it, add the :doc:`Download a file and read its text tool </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/onedrive/file-download>` to an Agent Node.
