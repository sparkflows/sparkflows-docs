Creating Azure Synapse Connection
++++++++++++++

Sparkflows enables you to create **Azure Synapse Connection** and use it to submit **jobs/workflows**. Connections can be at various levels:

  * **Global**  : Everyone has access to these connections.
  * **Group**   : Users belonging to the group have access to these connections.
  * **Project** : The owner of the project and the groups with which the project has been shared with have access to the project level connections.

Below are the steps to create Azure Synapse Connection:

Step 1 : Enable Azure Synapse in Sparkflows
--------------------

#. **Login** to Sparkflows.
#. Navigate to **Administration -> Configurations -> Connection**. 
#. **Enable** the Azure Synapse connection by setting the below parameter:

   ::

       connection.synapse.enabled : true

Step 2 : Add and Save the Connection
-------------------

Once you save the above configurations:

#. Navigate to **Administration -> Global/Group Connections -> Add Connections** as shown below:
