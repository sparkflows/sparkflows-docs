AWS S3
===========

Fire Insights enables you to use AWS S3 when it is configured.

By default, Fire Insights includes sample data bundled in its binary with a data folder in the home directory.

You can copy the data folder to a specified location in S3 and configure the path to be used in Fire Insights.

To configure the path, follow the steps below :

Step 1 : Login to Fire Insights
----------
#. Go to Fire Insights Login Page.
#. Enter your credentials to sign in.

Step 2 : Go to Administration Page
-----------------
From the Fire Insights home page, click on the **ADMINISTRATION** tab located in the top bar.

Step 3 : Go to Configurations Page
------------
From the administration page, click on the **Configurations** option.

Step 4 : Go to AWS Page
--------------
From the configurations page, click on the **AWS** tab located in the upper-middle bar.

Step 5 : Update the Path
-----------
On the AWS page :

#. Set the **value** column for **aws.enabled** field as **true** using the drop-down menu.
#. Enter the **S3 path** for **aws.homeDir** field.
#. Enter the **region** where S3 is to be configured in the **value** column of the **aws.region** field.

   **Note :** To edit the path, you are required to click on the edit icon located on the right-hand side (RHS) of each field.
    
    ::

        aws.enabled : true
        aws.homeDir : Specific s3 path
        aws.region  : Region where s3 is configured

#. Click on the **Save Configurations** button to save and update the path.

Step 5 : Access the File System
------------
Once you save the above configuration :

#. Navigate to **DATA/AWS S3** to access the same location that was configured in the previous step.
