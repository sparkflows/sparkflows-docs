Version 3.3.18 - January, 2026
====


New Features
-----

Platform & Infrastructure
++++

* **EMR Auto Scaling Support :** Support for Amazon EMR Auto Scaling using *Instance Groups* has been added, enabling dynamic scaling of cluster resources based on workload demand. The **Create EMR Pipeline** node has been updated to support *Managed Scaling Policies*, allowing automated and efficient resource management.

* **EMR Serverless Support (QA in Progress) :** Sparkflows now supports Amazon EMR Serverless, enabling serverless execution of Spark workloads without the need to provision or manage clusters.


Enhancements
----

Monitoring Enhancements
+++++

* **Enhanced Node-Level Metrics (In Progress) :** Node-level execution logs will now capture the *actual start and end time* of each node, providing improved execution visibility and performance analysis.


Copilot Enhancements
+++++

* **Improved Query Handling :** Copilot now detects and gracefully handles queries that are irrelevant to the target workflow or execution context.

* **Resilient MCP Query Processing :** If a query is not related to MCP, it will continue to be processed directly by the LLM even when the MCP server is unavailable. This ensures uninterrupted workflow generation and a more robust Copilot experience.


Security Enhancements
+++++

* **Group-Level Credential Store Integration :** Group-level ADLS, AWS, and GCP configurations can now securely pull secrets directly from the Credential Store (Key Vault / Secret Manager).

    * **Improved Group Configuration UI :**  
      ADLS, AWS, and GCP configurations are now organized into *separate tabs* at the group level.  
      A new pop-up has been introduced for configuring group-level ADLS, AWS, and GCP credentials.
    
    * **Credential Store Selection :** Users can now select the Credential Store at the configuration level. Once selected, secrets can be referenced using the format **$secret_key**, where *secret_key* corresponds to the value stored in the vault or secret manager.
    
    * **AWS Credential Store Enhancements :**  
      Support has been added for configuring *ARN* or *Access Key and Secret Key* at the group level.  
      Required credentials are now available to securely list and fetch secrets from the credential store.

MLflow Model Enhancements
++++

* **Log Models to MLflow :** ML models can now be manually logged and registered in MLflow directly from the ML Models page.
* **Automatic Model Versioning on Re-Training :** When a model is re-trained, a new version is automatically created and listed, enabling effective version tracking.
  
UI/UX Enhancements
++++

**MLflow**
  
  * **Champion Model Selection :** Users can now select a Champion Model directly from the ML Models page, making it easy to identify the production-ready model.
  
  * **Model Metrics Visibility :** Model performance metrics can now be viewed directly on the ML Models page for monitoring and comparison.
  
  * **Champion Model Selection During Model Load :** While loading a model for scoring or prediction, users can now choose the Champion Model option to automatically use the production model.
  
  * **Model Card View :** A new Model Card View has been introduced to provide a consolidated, visual summary of each model, including model identity, key metrics, workflow details, MLflow status, and quick actions.



Fixes
-----

Pipeline & Sensor Fixes
+++++

* **SnowflakeSensor XCom Value Fix :** Fixed an issue where XCom push values from previous nodes were not being replaced with actual values in the SnowflakeSensor.

* **TriggerNextDag Parameter Fix :** Resolved pipeline chaining issues related to **TriggerNextDag** parameters.

* **Run Snowflake Autocommit Support :** Added **autocommit=True** support for the **Run Snowflake** node to ensure proper transaction handling.


Documentation
---------------

* :ref:`User / Group / Role / Permission<User / Group / Role / Permission>` documentation has been updated with credential store integration for ADLS, AWS, and GCP, improved UI organization, secure secret referencing using **$secret_key**, and expanded AWS credential configuration support.  
  
* :ref:`Copilot with MCP Connection<Copilot with MCP Connection>` documentation is now updated to reflect improved query handling that gracefully processes non-MCP-related requests, ensuring uninterrupted workflow generation even when the MCP server is unavailable.  
 
* :ref:`Logs Search Examples<Logs Search Examples>` documentation is now updated to include node-level execution logs that capture actual start and end times for each node.
