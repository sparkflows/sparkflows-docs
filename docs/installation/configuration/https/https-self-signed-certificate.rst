HTTPS : Import Self-Signed Certificates
================================

Fire Insights comes with a self-signed certificate. It is available in ``conf/keystore.jks`` of fire-x.y.z directory. 

While this allows for basic HTTPS encryption, **self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers**, as they have not been issued by a recognized Certificate Authority (CA). This will trigger security warnings in the browser when accessing the application.

To suppress this warning message, you can import the self-signed certificate into the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** section of  your browser by following the steps below. However, this approach is only recommended for **local development and testing**.

.. warning:: **For production environments, it is strongly recommended to obtain a trusted SSL certificate from a CA** to ensure the highest level of security and trust for your users. Trusted SSL certificates enhance data integrity and builds user trust by removing browser warnings. You can follow our documentation for using SSL certificates issued by a CA here: https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/installation/configuration/https/ssl-certificate.html

Below are the steps to import self-signed certificate into your browser:
