=============

These features and Sparkflows platform improvements were released in November 2022.

Git Enhancements
-------
Sparkflows has enhanced its GIT capabilities by adding the below mentioned features:

- Project push to Git action

  We can now push a Project workspace directly to Git from the Project listing page.

  We will first follow the steps to link a project to its Git repository and then push that Project to Git. The below highlighted actions icon represent on how we can utilize the push action from the Project list page.

- Compare Workflow versions using the 'Git Diff' action

  We can now show the changes between the current workflow version and the previous workflow versions which has been pushed to git. 

  This menu action item will be available only after a workflow has been synced with Git. On selecting the 'Git Diff' menu.

Job Queue parallelism
------
When running in local mode, Sparkflows has enabled multiple parallel workflow execution to be processed instead of the earlier sequential processing.
