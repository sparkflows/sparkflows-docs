Open NLP
========

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning-based toolkit for the processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing services. OpenNLP also includes maximum entropy and perceptron-based machine learning.

Read `Apache OpenNLP Documentation <https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/manual/opennlp.html#intro.description>`_ for more details.

It features an API for use cases like Named Entity Recognition, Sentence Detection, POS tagging and Tokenization.


Read `Sparkflows OpenNLP Processors Documentation <https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/user-guide/generative-ai/gen-ai-nlq.html>`_ to gather more details on a few processors in sparkflows:

Sparkflows provides the below NLP functionalities leveraging OpenNLP:

* **Tokenization**: OpenNLP offers tokenization tools to split text into individual words or tokens, which is a fundamental step in many NLP tasks. Sparkflows leverages OpenNLP for tokenization within its NLP functionalities.

* **Sentence Splitting**: OpenNLP can identify and split text into sentences, making it useful for tasks that require sentence-level analysis. Sparkflows utilizes OpenNLP for sentence splitting.

* **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: OpenNLP provides part-of-speech tagging capabilities, which involve assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence. Sparkflows leverages OpenNLP for part-of-speech tagging.

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: OpenNLP includes NER models to identify and classify named entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more in text. Sparkflows utilizes OpenNLP's NER capabilities.

* **Chunking**: OpenNLP can perform chunking, which involves identifying and grouping words in sentences into syntactic chunks like noun phrases or verb phrases. Sparkflows integrates OpenNLP for chunking tasks.

* **Parsing**: OpenNLP supports syntactic parsing, allowing the analysis of sentence structure and the generation of parse trees or dependency trees. Sparkflows leverages OpenNLP's parsing capabilities.

* **Lemmatization**: OpenNLP offers lemmatization capabilities to reduce words to their base or dictionary forms, which can aid in text normalization. Sparkflows utilizes OpenNLP for lemmatization.

* **Tokenization for Specific Languages**: OpenNLP supports tokenization and other NLP tasks for multiple languages, making it suitable for multilingual text analysis. Sparkflows leverages OpenNLP's multilingual support.

* **Sentiment Analysis**: While OpenNLP may not have dedicated sentiment analysis models, Sparkflows can use OpenNLP as part of a larger sentiment analysis pipeline.

* **Custom NLP Pipelines**: Sparkflows can create custom NLP pipelines by integrating OpenNLP components into its workflows to perform a wide range of text analysis tasks, making it a versatile NLP platform.

* **Integration with Spark**: OpenNLP can be integrated into Sparkflows' data processing and analysis workflows when running on Apache Spark, allowing for distributed and scalable NLP processing.

* **Text Preprocessing**: OpenNLP can be used for various text preprocessing tasks, including removing stop words, stemming, and cleaning text data, all of which Sparkflows can leverage.

* **Language Detection**: OpenNLP can detect the language of a given text, which Sparkflows can use to determine the language of text data.

* **Spell Checking**: OpenNLP includes spell checking capabilities to identify and suggest corrections for misspelled words in text, which Sparkflows can use for text quality improvement.

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Custom Domains**: OpenNLP can be fine-tuned or adapted to recognize named entities specific to custom domains or industries, making it adaptable within Sparkflows' NLP workflows.
