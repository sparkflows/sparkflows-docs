* To create a chart, drag-and-drop columns from the **Dataset pane** on the LHS to **x** and **y axis** and add **filters** as per your need. As an example, we selected Bar Chart and updated column for x and y axis and added some filters, as shown below.

Step 4 : Save the Chart
-------
* To save the chart, provide the following details to your chart:
  
  * **NAME (Mandatory)**
  * **DESCRIPTION (Optional)**
  * **CATEGORY (Optional)**

* Now, click on **Save** button. Once the chart is successfully saved, it will appear on the Charts list page, as shown below.

  Similarly, you can create different charts using a specified chart type.
  
  Now, you are ready to create a new dashboard using existing chart(s).
