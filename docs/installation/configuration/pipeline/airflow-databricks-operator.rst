Airflow Snowflake Operators
======

The Airflow Snowflake Operators provide seamless integration between Apache Airflow and Snowflake. These operators allow you to automate tasks like executing SQL queries, loading data into Snowflake, or managing Snowflake objects (like tables, schemas, and databases) as part of your data workflows. By using these operators, you can integrate Snowflake tasks into your larger ETL or data engineering pipelines.
