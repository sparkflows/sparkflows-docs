    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/bike-rental-prediction`

    This workflow reads in a dataset and then it predicts the number of bikes to be rented in any given hour.

    ---  

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/farmers-market-prediction`

    Predict the number of farmer’s markets in a given zip code based on the income and taxes paid in a given area using the past data.

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/clustering-houses`

    Cluster the houses in the best possible way using KMeans algorithm availabe in Apache Spark ML.

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/tfidf`

    This workflow reads in a dataset. It then Tokenizes and performs TF/IDF on text content.

    :doc:`/tutorials/data-science/sparkml/earthquake-prediction`

    Motivation behind earthquake prediction is to empower crisis measures to decrease demise and devastation, inability to give notice of a significant earthquake that happens, or possibly a satisfactory assessment of the hazard, can bring about legitimate risk, or even political cleansing.
