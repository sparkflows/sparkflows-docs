Logs and Temp Files Cleanup
======
Configuration
++++++++++++

- Sparkflows offers automated log and temp directory cleanup for better disk space management.
- This job ensures efficient space management by deleting aged temporary data, improving overall system performance and disk utilization.
- The cleanup job can be configured by the admin in the ``application.properties`` file.

  ``0 0 12 * * ?``  -> default cron expression to trigger cleanup job.
- Once the above configuration is set, the cleanup job will execute based on the cron expression.
- The configuration used to delete log files based on a specified number of days is as follows: ``app.log.file.age.threshold``
- The configuration used to delete temp files based on a specified number of days is as follows: ``app.temp.file.age.threshold`` default value is 5 days.
- Users can configure the ``app.disk.threshold`` property to delete job logs based on disk size.
  By default, this value is set to 2 GB. If the size of the log files exceeds the configured threshold, older log files will be deleted.


Logs Cleanup Execution
+++++++++++++++++++++++
- Once logs cleanup is configured, the user can see the below log while restarting the application. 

  ::

    2024-10-14 12:52:51 [restartedMain] "fire-1" INFO  fireui.schedulerquartz.SchedulerQuartzSingleton - Scheduling Logs cleanup Job : cron pattern 0 0 12 * * ?

- The default cron expression of the clean up job will be executed  at 12:00 PM everyday.
- While trigger time of the cleanup jobs user can see the below logs for it.

- If the log file is older than the days which user configured in ``App.log.file.age.threshold`` , it will be deleted, and users can view the following logs 
  related to this action.

Disk Cleanup
+++++++++++++++++++++++

- Files within temporary folders will be automatically deleted based on the specified retention period defined in the ``app.temp.file.age.threshold`` configuration if the disk space is low.
- This setting manages the deletion of files in the /tmp directories according to the configured retention period in days.
- If disk space is less than configured threshold value, it will delete all the temp files older than configured temp file age threshold value.

Temp Directory Cleanup
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Cleanup job also automatically cleans up temporary files and folders in the /tmp directory. This job ensures efficient space management by deleting aged temporary data, improving overall system performance and disk utilization.

- User can configure temp directory location by setting **temp.dirs=/tmp** in **application.properties** file. User can input multiple comma separated temp folder.

- **Configurable File Age Threshold:** Application allows users to configure the file age threshold through the UI. Users can set the age (in days) for files and directories, determining which temporary data should be deleted. For example, setting the threshold to 5 days will delete all files and folders older than 5 days.

- **Improved Resource Management:** By automatically cleaning up temporary files, the system prevents unnecessary disk space consumption, contributing to optimized resource usage.

 .. Note:: Ensure the file age threshold is set according to your systemâ€™s temporary file usage pattern to prevent unintended deletions of files needed for ongoing processes.
