Possible causes are:

* The Postback Url configured in Fire Insights is configured wrongly.
* The Postback Url configured in Fire Insights is not accessible from EMR Livy.

* Test connectivity from the Apache Spark cluster to the postback URL from one of the machines of the cluster (EMR) using:

   ::

    curl https://<alb-host>/ -v
    
  .. note::  Make sure to replace 'alb-host' with your load balancer's domain name.
