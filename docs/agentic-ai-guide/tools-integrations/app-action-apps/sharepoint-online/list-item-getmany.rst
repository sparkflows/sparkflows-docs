   Lists the items of a list, each as one row with its id, dates, author and every column of the list.

Before you start
----------------

* A Microsoft Graph or SharePoint connection. See :doc:`how to set one up </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/sharepoint-online>`.

Add this step
-------------

#. Drag **App Action** from **Commonly used** onto the canvas and connect it where the step belongs.
#. **App:** choose **SharePoint**.
#. **Action:** under **List Item**, choose **List items in a list**.
#. **Details:** choose your Microsoft Graph or SharePoint connection, click **Test**, then fill in the boxes below.
#. Click **Load the fields from SharePoint** so later steps can use the columns, then **Save action**.

Fill in the details
-------------------

Type a value, or click a field under **What arrives here** to put a value from an earlier step into the box.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **Site**
     - No
     - The site's URL, name or id. Blank uses the site on the connection.
   * - **Fields to return**
     - No
     - Comma-separated field names. Blank returns the default set. For example ``name, path, size, webUrl``.
   * - **Limit**
     - No
     - How many rows at most. A run from the canvas previews 20. Default: ``100``.
   * - **List**
     - No
     - The list the items belong to: its name, for example Tasks, or its id.

Under **Advanced settings**:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 12 62
   :class: tool-params

   * - Box
     - Required
     - What to enter
   * - **Extra query parameters (JSON)**
     - No
     - Sent to the API unchanged, for a filter this form has no field for. For example {"timeMin": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z"}.
   * - **Nested fields**
     - No
     - Some records keep a value inside another value, such as a priority inside an issue. This decides how those inner values become columns.

       * ``deep`` (default): Every inner value gets its own column, named with dots, such as ``fields.priority.name``.
       * ``oneLevel``: Only the first level is split. Anything deeper stays in one column as JSON text.
       * ``json``: Each inner value stays whole, in one column of JSON text.

       See the example below the table.

**Nested fields, by example.** Take a record ``{"id": 7, "fields": {"priority": {"name": "High"}}}``. Each choice gives you these columns:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
   :class: tool-table

   * - Choice
     - Columns you get
   * - ``deep``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority.name`` = ``High``
   * - ``oneLevel``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields.priority`` = ``{"name": "High"}``
   * - ``json``
     - ``id`` = ``7`` and ``fields`` = ``{"priority": {"name": "High"}}``

Keep ``deep`` unless a later step needs the whole inner value as JSON.

What it passes on
-----------------

The records come out as rows, one per record. Click **Load the fields from SharePoint** to see the columns before you save.

A run from the canvas previews 20 rows, whatever **Limit** says.

Start a flow from it
--------------------

A :doc:`Trigger </agentic-ai-guide/triggers-automation/triggers>` can watch SharePoint with this action and start the flow when something new turns up. Pick **SharePoint** in the Trigger, then the event.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 32 68
   :class: tool-table

   * - Event
     - What it reports
   * - **File created in a library**
     - List is the document library's name, for example Documents. Reports each file added anywhere in the library, in any folder. Site is the site's address, which a SharePoint connection can already hold.
   * - **File created or modified in a library**
     - List is the document library's name, for example Documents. Reports each file added or saved anywhere in the library, with its name in FileLeafRef and its address in webUrl. Site is the site's address, which a SharePoint connection can already hold.
   * - **List item created**
     - List is the list's name, for example Tasks. Reports each item added to it since the last check. Site is the site's address, which a SharePoint connection can already hold.
   * - **List item created or modified**
     - List is the list's name, for example Tasks. Reports each item added or edited since the last check. Site is the site's address, which a SharePoint connection can already hold.
   * - **List item changed to match a condition**
     - List is the list's name, and Filter a condition on its columns by internal name, for example fields/Status eq 'Approved'. Reports each item that is edited and then meets the condition. Site is the site's address, which a SharePoint connection can already hold.

Let an agent decide instead
---------------------------

To let an agent call **List items in a list** only when a request needs it, add the :doc:`List items in a list tool </agentic-ai-guide/tools-integrations/connector-tools/sharepoint-online/list-item-getmany>` to an Agent Node.
