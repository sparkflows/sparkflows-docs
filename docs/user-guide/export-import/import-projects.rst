Import Projects
==============

Sparkflows enables you to Import Projects. These ZIP files can then be exported into another instance of Sparkflows.

Below are the steps for Importing Projects in Sparkflows.

   - Choose the **zip file** from your computer to import from. You must have downloaded this zip file from Sparkflows during the export process.
   - Select the **name of the project** which you want to import from the zip file. Sparkflows would display all the available projects in your zip file.

Select the Options for importing the Project
-----------------------------------------------

1. There are two options when importing Projects:

   * **Create a New Project**

     In this case, the selected Project would be imported as a new Project in Sparkflows. 

   * **Import to an existing Project**

     When importing to an existing Project, there are 3 possible methods to choose from:

      * **CREATE NEW WORKFLOWS, DATASETS, APPLICATIONS AND PIPELINES IF MATCHING UUIDS FOUND**

      * **OVERWRITE WORKFLOWS, DATASETS, APPLICATIONS AND PIPELINES IF SAME UUID FOUND**

      * **DELETE ALL WORKFLOWS, DATASETS, APPLICATIONS AND PIPELINES IN THE SELECTED PROJECT AND CREATE NEW ONES**


2. On successful import of the Project into Sparkflows, the success dialog box is displayed along with the details of the import.
