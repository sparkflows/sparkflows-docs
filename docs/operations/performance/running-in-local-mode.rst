Running in Local Mode
==============

When running in local mode, Fire Insights spawns a new process for executing the job on to the local machine.

You can pass ``-Xmx2548m -Xms1356m`` to specify the min and max heap size of the process in the case of Scala/Java workflows.

In the case of Python workflows, no specific memory parameters are specified.
