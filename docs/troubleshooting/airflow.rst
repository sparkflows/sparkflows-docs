* **Adjusting Docker Port:**

  * By default, Airflow using the Docker image is configured to run on port **8080**.
  * To mitigate potential conflicts, it is crucial to modify the fire server port to a different value, such as **8090** or any other open/available port.
  * For detailed instructions, refer the `Sparkflows Documentation on Running Custom Ports. <https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/installation/configuration/running-different-port.html>`_


* **Configuration Setting: app.postMessageURL**
  
  * Access the **Administration/Configuration** section.
  * Verify the configuration for **app.postMessageURL**. This setting dictates the Fire URL to which results from the Spark driver are posted back to the Fire server.
  * Ensure that the app.postMessageURL is correctly configured to establish seamless communication between the Spark driver and the Fire server.
