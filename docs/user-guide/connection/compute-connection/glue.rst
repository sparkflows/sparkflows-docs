AWS Glue Connection
----------------

Sparkflows enables you to create Aws Glue connection and use the connection to submit job on Aws Glue. Connections can be at various levels:

  * Global  : Everyone has access to these connections.
  * Group   : Users belonging to the group have access to these connections.
  * Project : The owner of the project and the groups with which the Project has been shared with have access to the Project level connections.

Below are the steps required to create Glue connection :

**1. Enable Glue in Sparkflows:**

Login to ``Sparkflows`` application -> ``Administration`` -> ``Configurations`` -> ``Connection`` -> and enable Glue connection by setting the below parameter:

::

    connection.glue.enabled : true

**2. Create global connections:**

Once you save the above configuration, navigate to ``Administration`` -> ``Global Connections`` -> ``Add Connections`` as shown below:
