    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/feature-engineering`

    Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from one or multiple existing features, potentially for use in statistical analysis.

    ---
    
    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/feature-transformation`
 
    Feature transformation is simply a function that transforms features from one representation to another.

    ---
    
    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/feature-selection`
    
    Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction.

    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/clustering`
    
    Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).

    ---

    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/regression`
    
    Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the ‘outcome variable’) and one or more independent variables (often called ‘predictors’, ‘covariates’, or ‘features’).

    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/classification`
    
    In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs.

    ---

    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/evaluation`
    
    Model evaluation aims to estimate the generalization accuracy of a model on future (unseen/out-of-sample) data.

    ---

    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/model-persistence`
    
    Spark ML models are saved into a directory with multiple files in it. Sparkflows has processors for saving and loading the Spark ML models.

    :doc:`/user-guide/machine-learning/sparkml/serving-sparkmllib-models`
    
    Reading a Spark ML model and scoring data using it.
