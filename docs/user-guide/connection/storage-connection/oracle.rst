Oracle Connection
================

Fire Insights provides the capability to create Oracle connection and use the connection for reading from and writing to Oracle. Below are the steps for creating Oracle connection in Fire Insights:

  * Download Oracle JDBC Driver
  * Install the JDBC Driver
  * Restart Fire Insights
  * Create the Oracle Connection

Download Oracle JDBC Driver
-------------

- Oracle JDBC Driver can be downloaded from : https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html or you can follow this guide: https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/maven-central-guide.html
- Use the JAR file for installation in the Fire.

Install the JDBC Driver
--------

In order to install the JDBC driver copy the driver jdbc jar file into ``fire-user-lib`` and ``fire-server-lib`` directories under the Fire installation home directory.

Restart Fire Server
------------

Once you have copied the JDBC driver into the required folder, restart the Fire server with ``./run-fire-server.sh restart`` for it to register the new driver.

This will restart the Fire services automatically.

Or else, you can also wait for 60 minutes and the JDBC driver would be automatically registered with Fire Insights.

Create the Oracle Connection
-----

Create the Oracle Connection at Global, Group or Project level.

Test Connection and Save
+++++

Once you have entered the connection details, click on ``Test Connection``. If the connection is successful,  click on ``Save`` to save the connection. 

Now, you are ready to start using the Connection in workflows.


.. Note:: Make sure that Oracle URL should be accessible from Sparkflows web server URL.
