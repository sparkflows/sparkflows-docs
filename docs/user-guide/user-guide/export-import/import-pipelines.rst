Importing Pipelines
==============

Fire allows you to import Projects. Below are the steps for importing Projects in Fire.

Go to the Projects Page
--------------------

- Click on the Import button.
- Choose the zip file from your computer to Import from. You must have downloaded this zip file from Fire during the export process.
- Select the name of the project which you would like to import from the zip file. Fire would display all the available Projects in your zip file.

Select the Options for importing the Project
-----------------------------------------------

There are two options when importing Projects:

* Import to a New Project

    * In this case, the selected Project would be imported as a new Project in Fire Insights. 

* Import to an Existing Project

When importing to an existing Project, there are 3 possible methods to choose from:

* Create new workflows and datasets when matching UUIDs found.

* Overwrite datasets and workflows if matching UUID found.

* Delete all workflows and datasets in the selected Project and create the imported workflows and datasets as new ones.


On Success
-------------------------------

On successful import of the Project into Fire Insights, the success dialog is displayed along with the details of the import.
