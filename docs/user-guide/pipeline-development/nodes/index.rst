EMR Nodes
=========
This document outlines the various nodes that can be added to a Pipeline in Sparkflows.

Various nodes can be added to a Pipeline. Some of them are listed below:

*	**Workflow** node can be added to a Pipeline to execute a Workflow. A Workflow node can be connected to another Workflow node thus forming a series of workflows that can be executed one after another.

.. note:: Workflow node is available only when Airflow Server is not configured.


Below is an example of a Pipeline with multiple Workflows.

Below is a list of nodes available when **Airflow** is enabled:
