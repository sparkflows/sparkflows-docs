Configure Chidori Connection
=====================

Sparkflows allows you to create a Chidori connection for submitting jobs and workflows. Connections can be created at various levels:

  * **Global**: Everyone has access to these connections.
  * **Group**: Users belonging to the group have access to these connections.
  * **Project**: The owner of the project and the groups with which the project has been shared with have access to the project level connections.

This document provides steps to create a Chidori Connection in Fire Insights.

Step 1 : Enable Chidori in Sparkflows
++++++++++

#. Login to **Sparkflows application**
#. Navigate to **Administration -> Configurations -> Connection** and enable **Chidori connection** by setting the below parameter:

::

    connection.chidori.enabled	 : true

.. Note::  #. Ensure that the **fire-spark_x.y.z-core-x.y.z-jar-with-dependencies.jar** and **workflowexecutecloud.py** files are uploaded to an S3 bucket or the Incorta cluster path. These files must be accessible from the Sparkflows webserver UI. The required jar files can be found in the Sparkflows binary by untarring **fire-x.y.z/fire-core-lib** and **fire-x.y.z/dist/**.

           #. For PySpark integration, install the Fire Python Wheel and the necessary Python packages on the Chidori cluster. You can download them from the following links:

              * Get the Fire Python wheel file from the link given below:  
                
                * `Fire Python Wheel File Download Link <https://sparkflows-release.s3.amazonaws.com/fire/incorta/spark_3.3.1/fire-3.1.0-py3-none-any.whl>`_
              * Get the Fire Python Packages from any of the below links: 

                * `Fire Python dependency 1 Download Link <https://sparkflows-release.s3.amazonaws.com/fire/incorta/spark_3.3.1/python_dependency/requirements-0-100.txt>`_

                * `Fire Python dependency 2 Download Link <https://sparkflows-release.s3.amazonaws.com/fire/incorta/spark_3.3.1/python_dependency/requirements-101-150.txt>`_

                * `Fire Python dependency 3 Download Link <https://sparkflows-release.s3.amazonaws.com/fire/incorta/spark_3.3.1/python_dependency/requirements-151-end.txt>`_
