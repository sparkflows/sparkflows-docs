Version 3.3.12 - November, 2025
=====

New Features
----

Authentication & Security
++++

* **Bearer Token Support :** Support has been added for using Sentinel Bearer Tokens for service accounts. Pipelines can now be triggered by including the Sentinel token in the request header: **Authorization: Bearer <sentinel_token>**. This improves authentication flexibility and enables secure, automated pipeline execution through service accounts.

Enhancements
----

Co-Pilot Improvements 
++++

* **Reduced Token Usage :** Co-Pilot has been enhanced to reduce token usage. Token consumption for each LLM step is now visible under **Activities**, showing detailed Input and Output token usage and various backend processing steps.

Pipeline Observability
++++

* **Enhanced Pipeline Execution Log Entries :** New log entries are now introduced to clearly indicate pipeline execution states: **Pipeline Starting**, **Pipeline Completed**, **Pipeline Failed**. These logs help users track execution flow and troubleshoot failures more easily.

Documentation
----

* `Copilot Examples <https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/user-guide/copilot/copilot-examples.html>`_ documentation is now updated for various example prompts in copilot to create and update workflows and pipelines.

* `Logs Search Examples <https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/operations/logs/logs-search-examples.html#pipeline-logs>`_ documentation is now updated with log formats for pipeline executions.
