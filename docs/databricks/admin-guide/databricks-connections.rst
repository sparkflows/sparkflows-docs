Databricks Connection
=======

Sparkflows enables you to create Databricks connection and use the connection to submit job on respective Databricks cluster. 

Connections can be at various levels:

  * Global : Everyone has access to these connections.
  * Group  : Users belonging to the group have access to these connections.
  * Project : The owner of the project and the groups with which the Project has been shared with have access to the Project level connections.

Below are the steps required to create Databricks connection:

Step 1 : Go to Connections Page
----------

#. **Login** to Sparkflows web server URL as an **Admin**.
#. Navigate to **ADMINISTRATION** Page from the top bar.
#. Click **Global Connections** from the Administration Page.

Step 4 : Test and Save Connection
---------------

#. Click **TEST CONNECTION**. You will get a success notification.
#. Click **SAVE** to save the connection.

   Once you save the connection, it can be used for submitting the job on specific Databricks cluster.

.. note:: Make sure to add a POSTBACK URL through which jobs running on Databricks will post back results to Sparkflows. Otherwise, it will use the URL specified in app.postMessageURL in the configuration.

More details on creating these connections can be found here : `Create Databricks Connection <https://docs.sparkflows.io/en/latest/user-guide/connection/compute-connection/databricks.html>`_


Setting Current Connection
------------------

A user can set their current connection from the list. Here, the user can choose from among the global, group level, or project level connections.


**Data or Databricks Clusters:**

Here, the user can choose between the global and group level connections. 

When the user lands on this page, the user's current connection is chosen by default.

**Data or DBFS:**

Here, the user can choose between the global and group level connections.

When the user lands on this page, the user's current connection is chosen by default.


**Data or Databricks Database:**

Here, the user can choose between the global and group level connections.

When the user lands on this page, the user's current connection is chosen by default.


**Workflow Editor:**

Here, the connection is chosen in the following order of priority:

  * Project level connection
  * Group level connection
  * Global connection
  
  
**Workflow Execute:**

Here, the connection is chosen in the following order of priority:

  * Current Connection (if it belongs to the same group as the workflow)
  * Project level connection
  * Group level connection
  * Global connection
    
**Analytical Apps:**

Here, the connection is chosen in the following order of priority:

  * Project level connection
  * Current Connection (but it cannot be from another Project)
  * Group level connection
  * Global connection
